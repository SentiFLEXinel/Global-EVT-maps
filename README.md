Hello!

We present the workflow for the retrieval of global maps in Google Earth Engine (GEE) of 4 Essential Vegetation Traits (EVTs): 

(1) fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (FAPAR)
(2) leaf area index (LAI)
(4) fractional vegetation cover (FVC)
(3) leaf chlorophyll content (LCC)


Sentinel-3 (S3) top-of-atmosphere (TOA) OLCI data is used with hybrid retrieval models to infer globally four essential vegetation traits (EVTs):
The models are based on Gaussian process regression (GPR) algorithms trained on SCOPE-6SV model simulations, and so applicable to process TOA OLCI date.

You can use the Colab file containing a Python script with comments and descriptions to retrieve the maps in your own GEE environment.
